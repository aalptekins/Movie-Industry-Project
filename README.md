# Movie-Industry-Project

This is a project that I have worked on data for my education process

I took the data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies this address

I tried to find what makes a movie successfull and what is the biggest correlation between the gross earning.

According to this data, votes and budges are the biggest factor with 0.62 and 0.71 correlation rates respectively.
